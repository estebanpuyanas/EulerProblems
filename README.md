WARNING: This repository contains spoilers for problems on Project Euler (projecteuler.net).

This repository contains my solutions to problems from Project Euler, a platform offering hundreds of mathematical and computational challenges. These problems range from basic arithmetic and algebra to advanced topics like number theory, combinatorics, and optimization. To further enhance my skills in data structures and algorithms, I am tackling these problems systematically, starting with the first 100 archived problems. These foundational challenges cover a broad range of mathematical concepts and difficulty levels. Once I complete the archive, I plan to work on newer problems as they are released.

Some solutions in this repository go beyond the original problem constraints to explore more generalized or optimized approaches. For instance, while Problem 4 requires finding the largest palindromic product of two three-digit numbers, my solution is generalized to handle two n-digit numbers. I am also developing an even more flexible solution to find the largest palindromic product of two numbers with lengths a and b, where a and b can differ. Such ongoing optimizations are noted with comments in the relevant code files.

Additionally, the repository includes a Pseudocode & Notes folder containing PDFs with my thought processes, notes, and key insights that guided my approach to the problem. These documents provide a detailed view of the problem-solving process and may be helpful to others tackling similar challenges. Since I found certain problems to be intuitive and straightforward, I only wrote notes for the problems I found more challenging, multidimensional, and thorough. 

Each code file follows the following structure: 

1. Top level pydoc with the name of the problem, its objective, and sometimes a brief case example. 
2. The relevant function(s) needed to solve the problem 
3. A main method which sets up the necessary information for the function(s) that solve the problem followed by a print statement so the user can see the result in the terminal. The set-up information in the main method can be changed to acquire different results as long as it does not attempt to break the logic of the function.
